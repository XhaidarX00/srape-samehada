# Anime Scraper Project

This project is a Python-based web scraping application designed to scrape anime data from the `samehada` website. It uses the Scrapy framework and incorporates features like auto-rotating proxies and fake user-agent headers to enhance scraping capabilities.

---

## Features
- Scrapes detailed anime information including title, Japanese and English names, status, type, and release date.
- Retrieves a list of episodes with details such as:
  - Episode thumbnails
  - Release dates
  - Streaming links
  - Download links in multiple resolutions (360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p)
- Utilizes proxy rotation and fake user-agent headers to bypass scraping restrictions.

## Configuration
### API Keys and Endpoints
To enable proxy rotation and user-agent spoofing, configure the following variables:

```python
# ScrapeOps API key
SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY = 'a497fde8-67fa-47a1-8e95-c15fc53f147e'

# Fake User-Agent Endpoint
SCRAPEOPS_FAKE_USER_AGENT_ENDPOINT = 'https://headers.scrapeops.io/v1/user-agents'

# Proxy Rotation Endpoint
ROTATE_PROXY_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.proxyscrape.com/v3/free-proxy-list/get?request=displayproxies&proxy_format=protocolipport&format=text'

# Enable Fake User-Agent
SCRAPEOPS_FAKE_USER_AGENT_ENABLE = True
```

## Sample Scraped Data
The scraper extracts data in JSON format. Below is an example of the output:

```json
[
    {
        "title": "Detail Anime 100-man no Inochi no Ue ni Ore wa Tatteiru 2nd Season",
